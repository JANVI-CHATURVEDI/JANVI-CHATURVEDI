### 💫 About Me
I'm **Janvi Chaturvedi**, a tech enthusiast who loves mixing **creativity + code** to build beautiful digital experiences.

From AI-powered tools to full-stack web apps, I’m on a mission to learn, create, and grow every day. Currently exploring Java, React, and how AI (like ChatGPT 😉) can help solve real problems.
